Django Act As Auth Backend
==========================

.. sales pitch start

Django authentication back-end that allows one to login as someone else
(an existing Django user allowed to login) without having to know their
password.

Great for customer support and testing scenarios!

Quickstart
----------

Install ``djactasauth``::

    pip install djactasauth

Add it to your auth backends in ``settings``::

    import djactasauth
    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...,
        'djactasauth.backends.OnlySuperuserCanActAsBackend',
        ...,
    )

Configure the custom login view to take advantage of all the features
in your ``urls.py``::

    from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
    from djactasauth.views import PrefillLoginView
    from testapp.views import whoami


    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^login/$', PrefillLoginView.as_view(), {}, 'login'),
    )


Then you can log in with username ``your_superuser_name/customer`` and password
``yourpassword``.
